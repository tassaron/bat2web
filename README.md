# bat2web
Ever wanted to turn a Windows batch file into a webapp running on a Linux server? Now you can.

# [Play Funtimes.bat on my website](https://rainey.tech/game/funtimes)

# Requirements
* Python 3.10.6
* Flask 2.3.2
* [Batchfile.py](https://github.com/tassaron/batchfile.py) 0.6 (my library)

# Backstory
When I was 16 I used to write text adventure games using batch files. See the [Batchfile.py](https://github.com/tassaron/batchfile.py) readme for more information. I wrote Batchfile.py so I could play my old batch file games without Windows, and turning that into a website seemed like a fun extension of the idea.
