# bat2web
Ever wanted to turn a Windows batch file into a webapp running on a Linux server? Now you can.

See an example: [Play FUNTIMES](http://bat.tassaron.com), a batch file game I made when I was 16

# Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Flask
* [Batchfile.py](https://github.com/tassaron/batchfile.py)

# Backstory
When I was 16 I used to write text adventure games using batch files. See the [Batchfile.py](https://github.com/tassaron/batchfile.py) readme for more information. I wrote Batchfile.py so I could play my old batch file games without Windows, and turning that into a website seemed like a fun extension of the idea.
